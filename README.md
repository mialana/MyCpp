# MyCpp

A repository for me to store functionalities and methods I commonly use in CPP-adjacent projects.
An added tidbit is that I will try to organize it in a directory structure which that, hypothetically, can be simply drag-and-dropped into every new project.

## Next Steps
- [x] Add auto-format script
- [ ] Add base `CMakeLists.txt` and `.pro` file for easy cmake and qmake integration
